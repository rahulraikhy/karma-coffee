# Project 3: Karma Coffee - Ethical Coffee from Around the World

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Project Overview

For my third project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course, we were given 7 days to create and build a full-stack website using 
Django and Python. For this project, we were split into 3 groups, both other groups had 4 team members, our group had 3 members.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Project Brief

- Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the User Model - one entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity.
- Use OAuth authentication.
- Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work
- Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features.
- Have a consistent and polished user interface.
- Be deployed online via Heroku

## Planning

As our first project collaborating as a group, we found the planning stage vital to establishing our build structure, and our design was vital to aiding us staying away from each other's code. Our first course of action was to create an ERD and wireframe for what we wanted our single coffee company e-commerce site to look like. The ERD was created by myself, and the wireframe (which ended up almost identical to our final product) was created by my team members, Ross and Jihyeon.

## ERD

## Trello

Due to this being a collaborative project, we followed Agile methodologies with effective communication enhanced by Trello. We were able to consistantly assign tasks to ourselves, label them on the board so others knew what we were working on, constantly progress onto the next step as we knew what others were working on, and synchronise our timings for when we wanted to test more important moments, like creating the skeleton app at the beginning so everyone could begin working on other pages, especially important as one of the three of us was working in a different timezone with approximately 6 hours difference in timezomes.

## Getting Started

Our group method to tackle this project was to divide key responsibilities between the three of us, and then assign pages for each of us to build, style, and implement our responsibilities across the pages. 

My key responsibility was to implement the user authorisation, a secondary authorisation (we had chosen google), create a sign up form and sign up page, a log in page, confirm a User could not leave, edit or delete reviews on coffee products without being logged in, and ensure the styling of these pages kept the theme of the overall website.

**Creating An Account**

![ezgif com-optimize (1)](https://github.com/rahulraikhy/karma-coffee/assets/121837375/7eaf1cc5-5880-4795-bd5b-98949cda9220)

**Logging in as an existing User**

![ezgif com-optimize (2)](https://github.com/rahulraikhy/karma-coffee/assets/121837375/5d395fb1-502a-4968-bb9e-ae1a77c8e53c)

**Google login**

![ezgif com-optimize (3)](https://github.com/rahulraikhy/karma-coffee/assets/121837375/e460ce25-7bf3-4e5b-bbfe-c117ab2abc14)

A key difference between the 3 modes of user authentication is that we wanted the user creating an account to be redirected immediately to the coffee product page, as we wanted them purchasing our products as quickly as possible.
Once a user already had an existing account, or logged in via google, they were redirected to the Karma Coffee Home Page, as we felt they are more likely to be returning customers.

Initialising user authentication using Django's inbuilt authentication was pretty easy, which was completed pretty much on day 1, which left us a great amount of time to focus on getting a consistant look throughout the website and free me up to aid the other team members with other jobs that required attention

After completing the Django User Authentication, we immediately decided to enter another authentication method, namely google. I did this using the AllAuth method. We chose the AllAuth method as is offerred us more scope for other authentication methods once google authentication was completed, in case we wanted to enter more, as opposed to the limited options presented by SocialAuth.

Settings.py
```
SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
    'google': {
        'SCOPE': [
            'profile',
            'email'
        ],
        'AUTH_PARAMS': {'access_type': 'online'}
    }
}
```
Login Template
```
        {% load socialaccount %}


        <a href="{% provider_login_url 'google'%}?next=/" class="btn btn-outline-secondary" style="width: 100%;">

Some simple CSS in making our login and signup forms look much more polished and professional, and I was finished with my tasks by the end of day 3, transforming this:

```
From day 4 onwards, I was free to contribute to the other team's needs, including creating content for the About, Home, and Index pages, aiding with implementation of the Stripe API (namely organising our group code in urls.py for the URL patterns, see below), and maintaining styling of the overall website.

```
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('main_app.urls')),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
    path('create-checkout-session/', CreateCheckoutSessionView.as_view(),
         name='create-checkout-session'),

    path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')),
]
```

## Biggest Challenge

The toughest part of this project was to link multiple models developed by different engineers, and ensure minimal impact was had on other developers' code.

Mobile responsive design was especially difficult, going forward, we would implement mobile responsive designs first.

## User Feedback

- [x] Add a larger selection of products
- [x] Allow users to see their order history
- [x] Checkout and purchase as a guest
- [x] Add other authorisation methods
- [ ] Better mobile view

## Next Steps

- Add Google's Places API to demonstrate locations of coffee production sites
- Standardise CSS styling across the site
- Improve the mobile view

## Wins

- **Working as a team of multiple developers on a single project**. This was the first time we'd worked on a project using GitHub as a team. Something we're expected to do in the industry, we're really happy to have achieved a great team dynamic and be able to resolve issues quickly and efficiently! This was especially prevalent as one of our team members was in a different time zone, so gaining experience with this early, as more companies incorporate working methods like "follow the sun" and have more developers/engineers across different timezones, was fantastic!

- **Creating an app people want to use.** We wanted to make something that highlighted the topics we're learning, and satisfies the project brief, but also something that we'd use and others want to use. From user feedback it seems that we achieved this, and that feel's awesome.

## Mistakes / Bugs

- **Bootstrap trappings** Whilst bootstrap made implementing styling quicker, it made custom styling especially difficult, particularly when it came to mobile responsive design.

- **GitHub Push and Pull Requests** As a team, early on, it was difficult to stay out of each others code and resolve conflict issues, but with practise and time, this became significantly easier.

- **OAuth google** If a user is using multiple accounts with similar names, google OAuth can be blocked.

- **No Edit Functionality on Reviews** At this current time, a user can only create and delete a review, they are unable to.

## Key Learnings

- **GitHub deployment requires constant communication** Working as part of team requires good communication at the best of times, but when creating an app and/or website, constant communication is vital. When pushing new code with additional functionality upstream, and especially when working on functionality that may depend on other developers supporting.

- **Mobile responsiveness first**It became very difficult to go back and tailer our content to mobile views, as such, implementing this first next project would be beneficial.

- **Trust each other**For our first group project, we were all hesitant at the start to delegate too much or too little work to each other, but as the project went on, we understood each other's skills, that everyone could and would contribute to the project.
