<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Planning

## ERD

**Inspiration**

One of the primary reasons our team decided on this topic is our shared passion for coffee. As coffee enthusiasts ourselves, we wanted to channel this passion into a project that would not only be technically challenging but also personally fulfilling.

**Aim**

To build a fullstack web application using Python, Django, and postgreSQL.

**Landing Page**

Users will land on a home page that showcases the essence of our coffee products, and by click 'Coffee' button to start exploring our products.

**Product Selection and Filters**

- Users can easily browse through our diverse collection of premium coffee beans each accompanied by enticing descriptions and visuals of the product.
- We will provide powerful search and filtering options, enabling users to quickly find their desired coffee based on roast level, origin, and more.

**Oauth/Login**

- Users will be able to sign up via Google OAuth.

**Profile Page**

- The user will have a profile page where they can see all of their past orders.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Project Brief

- Have at least 2 data entities in addition to the User Model - one entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity.
- Use OAuth authentication.
- Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work
- Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features.
- Have a consistent and polished user interface.
- Be deployed online via Heroku

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- [x] AAU, I want a way to login.
- [x] AAU, I want to see the products and product details.
- [x] AAU, I want to add items in the basket, and edit, delete the items in the basket.
- [x] AAU, I want to purchase products.
- [x] AAU, I want to be able to leave and delete reviews for the products I purchased.

## NTH - Nice to have

- [x] AAU, I want to be able to filter the products.
- [x] AAU, I'd like to see payment/order confirmation.
- [x] AAU, I'd like to see my order history.
- [x] AAU, I'd like to read about the company.
- [x] AAU, I'd like to be able to log in with Google.

## Biggest Challenge

The toughest part of this project was to link multiple models developed by different engineers, and ensure minimal impact was had on other developers' code.

Mobile responsive design was especially difficult, going forward, we would implement mobile responsive designs first.

## User Feedback

- [x] Add a larger selection of products
- [x] Allow users to see their order history
- [x] Checkout and purchase as a guest
- [x] Add other authorisation methods
- [ ] Better mobile view

## Next Steps

- Add Google's Places API to demonstrate locations of coffee production sites
- Standardise CSS styling across the site
- Improve the mobile view

## Wins

- **Working as a team of multiple developers on a single project**. This was the first time we'd worked on a project using GitHub as a team. Something we're expected to do in the industry, we're really happy to have achieved a great team dynamic and be able to resolve issues quickly and efficiently!

- **Creating an app people want to use.** I wanted to make something that highlighted the topics I'm learning, and satisfies the project brief, but also something that I'd use and others want to use. From user feedback it seems that I achieved this, and that feel's awesome.

## Mistakes / Bugs

- **Bootstrap trappings** Whilst bootstrap made implementing styling quicker, it made custom styling especially difficult, particularly when it came to mobile responsive design.

- **GitHub Push and Pull Requests** As a team, early on, it was difficult to stay out of each others code and resolve conflict issues, but with practise and time, this became significantly easier.

- **OAuth google** If a user is using multiple accounts with similar names, google OAuth can be blocked.

- **No Edit Functionality on Reviews** At this current time, a user can only create and delete a review, they are unable to.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Key Learnings

- **GitHub deployment requires constant communication** Working as part of team requires good communication at the best of times, but when creating an app and/or website, constant communication is vital. When pushing new code with additional functionality upstream, and especially when working on functionality that may depend on other developers supporting.

- **Mobile responsiveness first**It became very difficult to go back and tailer our content to mobile views, as such, implementing this first next project would be beneficial.

- **Trust each other**For our first group project, we were all hesitant at the start to delegate too much or too little work to each other, but as the project went on, we understood each other's skills, that everyone could and would contribute to the project.
